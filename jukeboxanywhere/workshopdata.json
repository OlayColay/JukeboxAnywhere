  "Description": "Use the Expedition Jukebox during gameplay! This was an idea originally suggested by Niaveterror815 on the Vinki server, but I think it\u0027s something we\u0027ve all been wanting!\r\n\r\n[h3]Features:[/h3][list]\r\n[*]Play songs from the jukebox anywhere during gameplay and in the sleep/death screen!\r\n[*]Use the repeat and shuffle buttons to affect how music is played even when the menu is closed\r\n[*]A button to take you to Rotwall\u0027s [url=https://threatmixer.netlify.app/]Threat Theme Webapp[/url]\r\n[*]Songs from the Watcher! You need the DLC active for them to show\r\n[*]Optionally turn off the Expedition requirements for unlocking songs\r\n[*]Optionally add modded songs to the jukebox (does not include threat themes)\r\n[*]Optionally add misc. vanilla songs to the jukebox (such as region intros and Leviathan Cave)\r\n[*]Several fixes for the bugs present in the vanilla Jukebox\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h3]Recommended Mods:[/h3][list]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924356705\u0026searchtext=music\u002Bannouncements]Music Announcements[/url]: See what songs are triggered by the game so that it\u0027s easy to find them later!\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h3]Known Bugs and Incompatible Mods:[/h3][list]\r\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2937085188]Vibe World[/url]: Makes songs play constantly, making the jukebox hard to use. Use that mod instead of this if you\u0027re looking to have specific music for the region you\u0027re in play more often.\r\n[*]Crashing when skipping through modded songs fast sometimes\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2]If you find any bugs or want to suggest features, please let us know on [url=https://discord.gg/hqpBUTrNzh]The Vinki discord server[/url], or [b]@OlayColay[/b] on the [url=https://discord.gg/rainworld]Rain World server[/url]![/h2]\r\n\r\nThank you to Beep for the thumbnail, and MaxDubstep for the gen alpha attention grabber screenshot!\r\n",
